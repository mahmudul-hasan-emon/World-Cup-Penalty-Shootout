# World-Cup-Penalty-Shootout

On Tuesday (November 6, 2022) in the Fifa world cup-Quatar-2022, two countries name, Morocco and Spain played out a gruelling 0-0 draw in 120 minutes of play, taking the Round of 16 game to penalties. In the decisive shootout, Spain had a shocker, missing their first three penalties to hand Morocco an unexpected, though deserved win and their first trip to the Fifa World Cup quarter finals.

Penalty shootouts have not been around forever. In fact in the more than 150-year history of organised football, they are a fairly recent phenomenon, being adopted over a period of time by different top level tournaments starting about 50 years ago.

Inspiring from this match, we three friends tried to make a project for our *** Computer Graphics *** course.
